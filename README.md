# DSA-Practice
💻 Java DSA Practice Repo 🚀 Solving DSA problems one bug at a time! From arrays and strings to trees, graphs, and dynamic programming — this is my journey to crack coding interviews and sharpen problem-solving skills. Clean code, logic boosts &amp; lots of coffee! ☕⚔️🧠


Welcome to my Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) journey in Java — a repo filled with logic, bugs (that I squashed 🐞), and lots of learning (fueled by coffee ☕)!

This repository is my personal space where I solve and document DSA problems while preparing for coding interviews, competitive programming, and overall skill-building as a developer. I'm using Java as my primary language to explore and implement everything from basic data structures to complex algorithms.

🌟 What You'll Find Here
✅ Clean Java Code for each problem

📚 Solutions categorized by topic (Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Trees, etc.)

🧠 Logic-first approach with readable implementations

💬 Comments and insights wherever needed

💪 Regular practice updates as I level up

📌 Topics Covered (and growing...)
Arrays & Strings

Linked Lists

Stacks & Queues

Recursion & Backtracking

Trees & Binary Trees

Binary Search

Dynamic Programming (my current boss fight 🧩)

Graphs, Greedy, Sliding Window, and more...

🎯 Why This Repo?
This isn't just for revision — it's my live log of progress, persistence, and patterns. Whether you’re a fellow Java warrior or just curious about DSA approaches, feel free to explore, fork, or suggest improvements!
